# SD-JWT support in golang

`sd-jwt` is a library that implements the IETF draft for [Selective Disclosure for JWTs](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-04.html).
This library facilitates creating combined formats for issuance and presentation with arbitrary payloads, and performing
verification from the holder or from the verifiers perspective.

## Installation

To install `sd-jwt`, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/cyware/ssi-sdk/sd-jwt
```

## Quick Start
See [this example](example/main.go).

You can run it by cloning this repo, changing directory into this directory, and running a go application.
See the terminal command below. 

```shell
git clone github.com/cyware/ssi-sdk.git
cd ssi-sdk/sd-jwt
go run example/main.go
```

## Usage
The best usage examples can be found in the [sd_jwt_test.go](sd_jwt_test.go) file.

## API Reference
See our [official godocs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyware/ssi-sdk/sd-jwt).

## Configuration
Configuration is done via dependency injection on the `SDJWTSigner` struct. 

If you want to inject your own implementation of JWT signatures, you can pass it by implementing a struct that satisfies
the `Signer` interface. 

If you want to inject your own random number generator, you can pass it by implementation the `SaltGenerator` interface.
We provide a default one which relies on `crypto/rand`, which you can instantiate by calling `NewSaltGenerator`.
